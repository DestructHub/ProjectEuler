"""
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is
called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor
decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just
over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact,
the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first
reaches 50% is 538.

Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the
time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.

Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is
exactly 99%.
